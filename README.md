# House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

# Introduction About Project

House Price prediction are very stressful work as we have to consider different things while buying a house like the structure and the rooms kitchen parking space and gardens. People don’t know about the factor which influence the house price. But by using the Machine learning we can easily find the house which is to be prefect for us and helps to predict the price accurately.

# Repository Overview
This repository is about the House Price Prediction with the help of the Linear Regression Algorithm.

* It has a jupyter notebook where all the coding has been done.
* It also has the relevant datasets and files used for this analysis.



# Data Collection
 For this project we used the data that is available on kaggle. These are the major point about the data set.
* square: The square of house
* livingRoom: The number of living room
* drawingRoom: The number of drawing room
* kitchen: The number of kitchen
* bathroom: The number of bathroom
* floor: The height of the house.  
* buildingType: Including tower( 1 ) , bungalow( 2 )，combination of plate and tower( 3 ), plate( 4 ).
* constructionTime: The time of construction
* renovationCondition: Including other( 1 ), rough( 2 ),Simplicity( 3 ), hardcover( 4 )
* buildingStructure: Including unknow( 1 ), mixed( 2 ), brick and wood( 3 ), brick and concrete( 4 ),steel( 5 ) and steel-concrete composite (6).
* fiveYearsProperty: If the owner have the property for less than 5 years.
* city: Location of house.


# House Price Prediction with Linear Regression Involves Following Steps:

* Dataset Collection: Gather historical house price data and corresponding features from platforms like Zillow or Kaggle.
* Data Preprocessing: Clean the data, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering, such as converting categorical variables to numerical representations.
* Splitting the Dataset: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets for model building and evaluation.
* Building the Model: Create a linear regression model to learn the relationships between features and house prices.
* Model Evaluation: Assess the model’s performance on the testing set using metrics like MSE or RMSE.
* Fine-tuning the Model: Adjust hyperparameters or try different algorithms to improve the model’s accuracy.
* Deployment and Prediction: Deploy the robust model into a real-world application for predicting house prices based on user inputs.


# Conclusion
The House Price Prediction analysis using Linear Regression (Single Variable) is a fundamental example of predictive modeling. While this simplified approach focuses on a single attribute, real-world scenarios involve multiple variables and more complex models. Linear Regression serves as a stepping stone to more advanced regression techniques.

As we engage in this analysis, we recognize the significance of accurate house price prediction in real estate and investment decisions.
